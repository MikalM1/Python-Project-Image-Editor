# Python-Project-Image-Editor

This Python code takes your image, makes changes to it, and saves it in another folder. First, it opens an image (using the module Image) with a certain path and 
saves it to an object. Then, it edits the image (using the module ImageFilter in PIL package) using filter, convert, and rotate. Then, it enhances the contrast of 
the image (using module ImageEnhance in PIL package). Finally, it saves the edited image in a folder.
